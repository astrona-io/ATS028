# Repair Readiness Without Removing It Solution

Use a host shell with this lab's private kubeconfig. A kubeconfig identifies the cluster and credentials used by kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool. This environment is separate from the ungraded playground.

```sh
export KUBECONFIG="$(astrona kubeconfig ats-028-lab-020-01-01)"
test "$(kubectl config current-context)" = "kind-astro-ats-028-lab-020-01-01" || exit 1
```

Keep this connection selected throughout the task. Every script supplied by the lab refuses a different context.

## Inspect And Explain

The application starts with an intentional readiness port error in its probe. Inspect the Pod events and the configured listener before changing the probe.

Inspect the relevant evidence:

```sh
kubectl -n starfleet describe pods -l app=probe
kubectl -n starfleet get deployment probe -o yaml
```

A readiness failure removes a Pod from ready Service backends. It does not tell the kubelet to restart the container. Compare the probe port with the application listener and correct the check. A running process alone is insufficient: readiness and the client request must also recover.


Save this as `deployment-probe.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: probe
  namespace: starfleet
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: probe
      release: probe
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: probe
        release: probe
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: probe
        image: docker.io/library/python:3.13-alpine
        command:
        - python
        - /app/server.py
        env:
        - name: VERSION
          value: v1
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: http
          periodSeconds: 2
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 10m
            memory: 32Mi
          limits:
            memory: 128Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: app
          mountPath: /app
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: app
        configMap:
          name: probe-code
```

Apply the required change:

```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment-probe.yaml
```

## Verify The Result

Observe the actual result. A denied-request command returns a nonzero status when the denial works. Run denial checks separately from a shell sequence that stops on the first nonzero status.

```sh
kubectl -n starfleet rollout status deployment/probe --timeout=180s
kubectl -n starfleet exec shuttle -- wget -q -T 3 -O- http://probe/
kubectl -n starfleet exec deployment/probe -- python -c 'import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('"'"'http://127.0.0.1:8080/health'"'"',timeout=3).status)'
```

Repair the readiness probe on `probe` to HTTP path `/ready` and named port `http`. Keep the application command, image, two replicas and original Service. Both replicas must become ready and available. The original client must receive version one. Do not remove the readiness check.

After recording the result, remove this independent lab with `astrona destroy ats-028-lab-020-01-01`.

## Common pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> Repair the probe port instead of removing the readiness probe. Running is not the same as ready. Check both rollout convergence and the original Service request.
